## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Swap the limited word bank for a file containing a much larger bank of words
* [ ] Re-work the word selection to be compatable with the file format rather than seperated lists
* [ ] Work on balancing the game better (hard difficulties are essentailly impossible and even easy ones  are difficult)
